## üìå Overview

### üéØ Inspiration

From the creator, one of the problems of the first season of the hit Netflix show, Squid Game, is that some of the strategies are very dumb. One of the games is related to marbles. The games played in this event are notoriously luck based and forces the player to be so full of itself, when it's not. That's where this game comes in! This game doesn't rely on luck or constant betting. It relies on your mind. 

Here're some rules to it. 

1. Player can pick marbles on either one or both sides. But if the player pick marbles on both sides, they have to be the same amount.
2. Whoever picks the last marble wins.
